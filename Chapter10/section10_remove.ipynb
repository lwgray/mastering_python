Today, we will delve into the process of creating our very own functions in Python. This concept is not only foundational but offers a new level of creativity and efficiency in coding.\n","\n","### Why Functions?\n","\n","Functions are essential building blocks in programming. They provide a structured way to organize code, allowing us to perform specific tasks repeatedly without rewriting the code. Here's why functions are valuable:\n","\n","- **Modularity**: Functions enable us to break down complex problems into manageable parts, enhancing clarity and maintainability.\n","- **Reusability**: Once a function is defined, it can be reused throughout the code, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy.\n","- **Abstraction**: Functions encapsulate specific logic, so we don't need to understand every detail inside the function to use it effectively.\n","- **Code Organization**: By grouping related code into functions, we can create more organized and readable code.\n","\n","### Defining Functions\n","\n","Defining a function in Python involves specific syntax and rules. We use the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we can define the input parameters that the function accepts. The body of the function, containing the logic, is indented below the definition.\n","\n","In the following sections, we will explore examples and practice writing functions to solidify our understanding."],"metadata":{"id":"S36N-mgTuStz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Example: A Simple Greeting Function\n","\n","Here's a straightforward example of a function that takes a name as an input and prints a greeting message:\n"],"metadata":{"id":"VpWZ_WLjuZwT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def greet(name):\n","    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")"],"metadata":{"id":"IiaLgpiounCZ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","In this example, `greet` is the name of the function, and `name` is the parameter it accepts.
