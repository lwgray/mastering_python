It's time to play around with functions in Python. Professor Python has cooked up some really fun exercises for you to flex those coding muscles. So, put on your coding hats and get ready to write some Python functions!\n","\n","### Instructions:\n","1. For each exercise, write a function that performs the given task.\n","2. Test your function with some example inputs to ensure it's working as expected.\n","3. Comment your code to explain the logic behind your solution.\n","\n","Ready? Let's get started!\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Exercise 1: Piggy Bank üê∑\n","Create a function to calculate the total amount in your piggy bank! Your function should:\n","- Accept four arguments: the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters you have.\n","- Calculate the total amount you've got stashed away in dollars and cents.\n","- Return the total amount in dollars as a float.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","print(piggy_bank(10, 5, 2, 3))  # Should return 1.05\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Exercise 2: Movie Night üçø\n","Movie nights just got a whole lot easier! Write a function to help you pick the perfect film. Your function should:\n","- Accept a list of movies, where each movie is a dictionary with a 'title' and a 'genre'.\n","- Take a second argument for the genre you're in the mood for.\n","- Filter out and return a list of movies that match your chosen genre.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","movies = [{'title': 'Inception', 'genre': 'Action'}, {'title': 'Shrek', 'genre': 'Animation'}]\n","print(movie_night(movies, 'Action'))  # Should return [{'title': 'Inception', 'genre': 'Action'}]\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Exercise 3: Weather Forecast ‚òÄÔ∏è‚òî\n","Ever stepped out in shorts on a freezing day? Let's make sure that never happens again! Create a function to suggest what to wear based on the weather. Your function should:\n","- Accept the current temperature and the weather condition (e.g., \"sunny\", \"rainy\").\n","- Give you a string recommendation on what to wear for the day.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","print(weather_forecast(75, 'sunny'))  # Should return 'Wear a t-shirt and sunglasses!'\n","```\n","\n","Good luck and have fun coding! üéâ"],"metadata":{"id":"GTb7mMYfczMW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"f5cpJMaYdLWe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
