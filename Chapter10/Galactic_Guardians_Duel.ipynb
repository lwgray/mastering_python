The \"Galactic Guardians Duel\" is a card game where players use celestial cards, each representing a guardian of a galaxy with unique power levels and abilities.\n","\n","Two players will each draw a card from their deck and play it. Each card has two attributes: Power and Ability. The card with the higher Power wins, but the Ability can modify the Power of its own or the opponent's card.\n","\n","The rules for the abilities and powers in the \"Galactic Guardians Duel\" card game are as follows:\n","\n","### Card Attributes:\n","1. **Power**: Every card has a Power value, which is a number between 1 to 10. This Power value determines the basic strength of the card.\n","2. **Ability**: Each card also has an Ability. There are three types of abilities: \"Boost\", \"Drain\", and \"Shield\".\n","\n","### Abilities:\n","\n","1. **Boost**:\n","    - Effect: Increases the card's Power by 2.\n","    - Example: If a card with a Power of 5 and the \"Boost\" ability is played, its effective Power becomes 7 for that round.\n","\n","2. **Drain**:\n","    - Effect: Decreases the opponent's card Power by 2.\n","    - However, if the opponent's card has the \"Shield\" ability, then the \"Drain\" effect is nullified.\n","    - Example: If a card with a Power of 7 and the \"Drain\" ability is played against a card with a Power of 6, the opponent's card's Power decreases to 4 for that round, unless it has the \"Shield\" ability.\n","\n","3. **Shield**:\n","    - Effect: Protects the card from the \"Drain\" ability of an opponent's card.\n","    - If the opponent plays a card with the \"Drain\" ability, the \"Shield\" prevents the Power reduction.\n","    - Example: If a card with a Power of 6 and the \"Shield\" ability is played against a card with the \"Drain\" ability, its Power remains 6 for that round.\n","\n","### Gameplay:\n","\n","1. Both players draw a card from their deck.\n","2. The abilities of the drawn cards are applied:\n","    - If a card has the \"Boost\" ability, its Power is increased by 2.\n","    - If a card has the \"Drain\" ability, the opponent's card Power is decreased by 2, unless the opponent's card has the \"Shield\" ability.\n","    - The \"Shield\" ability protects a card from the \"Drain\" effect of an opponent's card.\n","3. The card with the higher Power after applying the abilities wins the round.\n","4. If both cards have the same Power after applying the abilities, the round is a draw.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8J9AuBzXl9lb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Game Decomposition:\n","\n","**Markdown Explanation:**\n","\n","1. **draw_card(deck)**:\n","    - Input: List of cards (deck).\n","    - Operation: Randomly draw a card.\n","    - Return: The drawn card.\n","\n","2. **apply_ability(card1, card2)**:\n","    - Input: Two cards.\n","    - Operation: Adjusts the power of the cards based on their abilities.\n","    - Return: Modified power values for both cards.\n","\n","3. **get_round_winner(card1, card2)**:\n","    - Input: Two cards.\n","    - Operation: Determines which card wins based on modified power.\n","    - Return: The name of the winning card or \"Draw\".\n","\n","4. **play_game()**:\n","    - Input: None.\n","    - Operation: Orchestrates a single round of the game, from drawing cards to declaring a winner.\n","    - Return: None (prints results to the console).\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SBl109kdmZZO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","# Sample deck (expandable)\n","deck = [\n","    {\"Name\": \"Andromeda Avenger\", \"Power\": 5, \"Ability\": \"Boost\"},\n","    {\"Name\": \"Milky Way Mage\", \"Power\": 7, \"Ability\": \"Drain\"},\n","    {\"Name\": \"Orion Outlaw\", \"Power\": 6, \"Ability\": \"Shield\"},\n","    # ... add more cards\n","]\n","\n","def draw_card(deck):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Randomly select a card from the deck.\n","\n","    Parameters\n","    ----------\n","    deck : list of dict\n","        The list of cards to draw from.\n","\n","    Returns\n","    -------\n","    dict\n","        A card with name, power, and ability.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    ___2___ # Fill in logic here.\n","\n","def apply_ability(card1, card2):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Modify the power of cards based on their abilities.\n","\n","    Parameters\n","    ----------\n","    card1 : dict\n","        The card played by Player 1.\n","    card2 : dict\n","        The card played by Player 2.\n","\n","    Returns\n","    -------\n","    tuple\n","        The modified power of card1 and card2.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Initialize with original power values\n","    power1, power2 = card1[\"Power\"], card2[\"Power\"]\n","\n","    # Check abilities and modify power accordingly\n","    # Hint: Use if-else conditions to check card abilities and modify powers.\n","    # You want to add or points to power based on abilities\n","    # This is based on the type of cards that are being compared.\n","\n","    ___3___ # Fill in logic here\n","\n","    return power1, power2\n","\n","def get_round_winner(card1, card2):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Determine the winner of a round based on card power and abilities.\n","\n","    Parameters\n","    ----------\n","    card1 : dict\n","        The card played by Player 1.\n","    card2 : dict\n","        The card played by Player 2.\n","\n","    Returns\n","    -------\n","    str\n","        Return the name of the winning card based on who has the highest power\n","        or return `Draw` if powers are the same\n","    \"\"\"\n","    power1, power2 = apply_ability(card1, card2)\n","    ___4___ # Fill in logic here\n","\n","def play_game():\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Execute the main game logic for a single round duel.\n","\n","    Returns\n","    -------\n","    None\n","    \"\"\"\n","    card1 = ___5___ # Fill in logic here\n","    card2 = ___6___ # Fill in logic here\n","\n","    print(f\"Player 1 plays: {card1['Name']} with {card1['Ability']}\")\n","    print(f\"Player 2 plays: {card2['Name']} with {card2['Ability']}\")\n","\n","    winner = get_round_winner(card1, card2)\n","    ___7___ # Fill in logic here\n","\n","play_game()"],"metadata":{"id":"Uj5FEoYJmlNA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
