It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable problems or tasks, and then addressing each one individually.\n","\n","Let's work through an example: Suppose we are given a problem to create a program that takes in a list of students with their grades and calculates the average grade, highest grade, and the name of the student with the highest grade.\n","\n","Here is how we would decompose this problem:\n","\n","**Problem Decomposition:**\n","\n","1. Understand the problem: Clearly understand what input is given (a list of students with their grades) and what output is expected (average grade, highest grade, student with the highest grade).\n","\n","2. Break the problem down: This problem can be broken down into three tasks:\n","    - Task 1: Calculate the average grade\n","    - Task 2: Calculate the highest grade\n","    - Task 3: Find the student with the highest grade\n","\n","3. Map each task to a function: Each task can be encapsulated in a function which performs a specific operation.\n","\n","Now, let's write Python code for each task:\n","\n","The code should decompose the problem into smaller parts, addressing each with a specific function. The logic behind each task and function is outlined in the comments. Each function independently solves a small part of the problem, making the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dFGJOm07CjK_"}}]}
