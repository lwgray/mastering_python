Introducing Methods\n","**Functions and Methods: A Comparative Study**\n","\n","In Python, you'll encounter both functions and methods, and it's crucial to understand the difference between the two. While both are used to perform specific operations, methods are associated with objects. Functions, on the other hand, are standalone pieces of code that can be called without any object association.  Here's how to call a function and a method."],"metadata":{"id":"ktryIm3tlQOE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Function\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")\n","\n","# Method\n","sentence = \"this is an example\"\n","capitalized_sentence = sentence.capitalize()\n","print(capitalized_sentence)"],"metadata":{"id":"iCxMjrdwlDQd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 2. A Method's Contrast to Functions\n","While both functions and methods in Python are called to execute blocks of code, they are not the same. Methods are inherently tied to the object they belong to.

Given that this method operates on a string, it inherently knows the main string it's analyzing.
