The game continues until a player accumulates 2 points or until a total of 6 guesses have been made, whichever comes first.\n","\n","## Components\n","\n","### Players\n","\n","The game includes four players: 'Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', and 'Player4'.\n","\n","### Scores\n","\n","Each player starts with a score of 0. The scores are stored in a dictionary and updated throughout the game.\n","\n","### Target Number\n","\n","A random number between 1 and 10 is generated at the beginning of the game. This is the target number that players aim to guess.\n","\n","### Guesses\n","\n","Players make guesses from a set of allowed numbers (1 to 10). Each guess is recorded in a set to keep track of the total number of guesses made during the game.\n","\n","### Winning Conditions\n","\n","- A player wins if they accumulate 2 points.\n","- The game ends if a total of 10 guesses have been made without any player reaching 2 points.\n","\n","### Game Flow\n","\n","1. A random player is chosen to make a guess from the set of allowed numbers.\n","2. If the guess is within an \"epsilon\" (allowed difference) of 1 from the target number, the player earns a point.\n","3. The player's score is updated in the scores dictionary.\n","4. The game checks for winning conditions:\n","   - If a player reaches 2 points, they are declared the winner, and the game ends.\n","   - If 6 guesses have been made without any player reaching 2 points, the game ends without a winner.\n","\n","## Output\n","\n","The game outputs the current score after each guess and announces the winner if there is one at the end of the game.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","The Number Guessing Game is a fun and straightforward way to engage multiple players in a race to accurately guess a random number. It incorporates elements of chance, strategy, and competition, making it an exciting quick game to play."],"metadata":{"id":"o88TYHZriQIl"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f-yawU1jE0M8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693073972011,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":126,"user":{"displayName":"Lawrence Gray","userId":"13939893748745511637"}},"outputId":"432ca42d-7648-4f64-f7b8-47beb6eb9ef9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["8\n","Player4 guessed 10.
