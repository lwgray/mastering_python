In this coding assignment, you will practice using the different data types in Python and get familiar with their properties.\n","\n","1. Define the following variables with the correct data types:\n"," * A string called “name” and assign it your full name as a string value.\n"," * An integer called “age” and assign it your current age as an integer value.\n"," * A float called “height” and assign it your height in meters as a float value.\n"," * A boolean called “is_student” and assign it True or False depending on whether you are a student or not.\n","2. Print out each of the variables you created in step 3 to make sure they have the correct values.\n","\n","3. Create a list called “favorites” and assign it the following values: your favorite color, favorite food, and favorite movie as strings.\n","\n","4. Use the “len” function to find the length of the “favorites” list.\n","\n","5. Create a dictionary called “personal_info” and assign the following key-value pairs:\n","        a. “name”: your full name as a string\n","        b. “age”: your age as an integer\n","        c. “height”: your height in meters as a float\n","        d. “is_student”: True or False depending on whether you are a student or not.\n","6. Use the “keys” method to find the keys in the “personal_info” dictionary.\n","\n","7. Use the “values” methods to find the values in the “personal_info” dictionary."],"metadata":{"id":"0sdcZBc0N3YL"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"RwR7K6ekNtyS"},"outputs":[],"source":["name = \"Larry Gray\"\n","age = 43\n","height = 1.8\n","is_student = False\n","\n","print(name, age, height, is_student)\n","\n","favorites = ['blue', 'pho', 'blue streak']\n","\n","len_favorites = len(favorites)\n","\n","personal_info = {\"name\":name, \"age\": age, \"height\": height,\n","                 \"is_student\": is_student}\n","\n","keys = personal_info.keys()\n","values = personal_info.values()"]}]}
