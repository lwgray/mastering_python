The players in the game are represented as a list of strings, named `players`. The scores dictionary keeps track of each player's score. The `guesses` set stores the guesses made in the game. The `target` is a randomly chosen integer between 1 and 20, which players aim to guess. An `epsilon` float is used as a range within which a guess is considered correct. The `game_on` boolean indicates whether the game is still ongoing. The `winners` variable will hold the winner of the game, and it's initially set to `None`. The `allowed_attempts` tuple defines the range\n","of possible guesses.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"o88TYHZriQIl"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f-yawU1jE0M8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1688334604200,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":132,"user":{"displayName":"Lawrence Gray","userId":"02063702204271817666"}},"outputId":"bf94aae8-6f0c-419a-9f73-1d0ad47f3853"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Player4 guessed 4.
