The syntax for a function always is first the name of the function; then open parens; then a comma delimited list of arguments; then a closing parens. In our case, we gave as the argument to the print() function the sequence of characters \"hello\". So we were essentially telling the Python interpreter, \"I want you do to the action print on the characters h-e-l-l-o\".\n","\n","You can send multiple arguments at once separated by commas; how they are used depends on the function.
