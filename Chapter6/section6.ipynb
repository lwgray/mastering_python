This is useful in Python, and in programming in general, because it makes it easier to construct strings dynamically. Instead of concatenating pieces of strings and variables together, you can use string interpolation to insert values directly into a string.\n","\n","Python supports multiple ways to format strings, and each has its benefits and use cases. The three main methods of string formatting in Python are:\n","\n","The old-style `%` operator.\n","The `str.format()` method.\n","F-Strings, also known as formatted string literals, introduced in Python 3.6.\n","\n","We will focus on F-Strings.\n","\n","It is important to note that the `print()` function, on the other hand, is not a method of string formatting or interpolation; instead, it is a function that outputs text to the console.
