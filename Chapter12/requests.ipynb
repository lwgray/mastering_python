What is an API?\n","An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows different software entities to communicate with each other. In simple terms, it's like a menu in a restaurant: you (the software application) ask for a specific item (data or service), and the kitchen (the server) provides it to you.\n","\n","## 2. What is a RESTful API?\n","REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A RESTful API uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data represented in a stateless manner, typically in JSON format.\n","\n","## 3. Why Use APIs?\n","APIs provide a standardized way to interact with external services and data. They save you from having to build functionality from scratch, allowing you to stand on the shoulders of giants. For instance, you can use a weather API to fetch weather data instead of creating your own weather data algorithms and collection systems.\n","\n","## 4. How Do APIs Work?\n","APIs function on a request-response model. You send a request to an API and get a response back. The request may contain parameters that specify the data you want to retrieve or modify. The response contains the requested data and usually comes in a structured format like JSON or XML.\n","\n","## 5. Introduction to the `requests` Module\n","Python's `requests` library is a simple yet powerful tool for making HTTP requests. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind simple APIs, allowing you to send HTTP/1.1 requests.\n","\n","## 6. HTTP Methods\n","HTTP methods dictate what action we are trying to perform with the API. Here are some common ones:\n","- **GET**: Retrieve data\n","- **POST**: Submit data for processing\n","- **PUT**: Update existing data\n","- **DELETE**: Remove data\n","\n","## 7. Status Codes\n","HTTP status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request. Some common ones are:\n","- **200 OK**: The request was successful\n","- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found\n","- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server\n","\n","## 8. JSON Data Format\n","JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write. It is often used for transmitting data in web applications and APIs.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 9.
