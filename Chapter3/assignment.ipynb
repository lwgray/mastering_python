It provides a means to store and retrieve data using a unique identifier or name. This is especially beneficial when dealing with complex data structures or when crafting your own functions. The ability to reference data using assigned variable names makes your code more readable, manageable, and efficient.\n","\n","Variable assignment is achieved using an equal sign (=) operator. The item on the left of the operator is the name, or \"namespace,\" assigned to represent the data, which is positioned on the right of the operator. Here are some fundamental rules regarding namespaces:\n","\n","- Namespaces should begin with an alphabetical character, with no spaces or special characters allowed, except for underscores (_).\n","- From the point of assignment onwards, the right-side data can be referenced using the left-side name.\n","- These names or identifiers are collectively referred to as **variables**.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"uUaB1a4NValR"},"outputs":[],"source":["dogs_name = \"Luna\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"s2xdRYkiValR"},"outputs":[],"source":["dogs_name"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Bx4RV8HdValR"},"outputs":[],"source":["number_of_students_in_class = 24"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yhcUtgyCValR"},"outputs":[],"source":["number_of_students_in_class"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6Fm7DP7lValR"},"source":["# Best Practices for Variable Naming\n","\n","Adopting a consistent and understandable variable naming convention enhances the readability and maintainability of your code, particularly for future users. Here are some widely-accepted conventions:\n","\n","- **Lowercase letters:** Variable names should be entirely in lowercase.\n","- **Use of underscores:** Underscores should be used to represent spaces between words in a variable name.\n","- **Descriptive names:** Choose names that convey some sense about the type or purpose of the data it represents. It should be human-readable and meaningful to others who might interact with your code in the future.\n","\n","By employing clear and meaningful variable names, you aid future developers who may read or maintain your code. This practice also helps you keep your own code organized, making it easier to navigate and troubleshoot."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["number_of_apples = 10"],"metadata":{"id":"Y-RVNxPcEAQu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
