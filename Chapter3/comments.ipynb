They play a vital role in code understanding, documentation, collaboration, and maintaining code readability.\n","\n","**Key Points:**\n","1. Comments are used to explain complex code sections, document functions or classes, facilitate teamwork, and aid in debugging.\n","2. Python supports two types of comments: single-line comments (starting with `#`) and multi-line comments (enclosed in triple quotes).\n","3. Single-line comments extend until the end of the line, while multi-line comments are often used as docstrings for functions or classes.\n","4. Best practices for writing comments include being clear and concise, using proper grammar and punctuation, avoiding redundant comments, updating comments with code changes, and using meaningful names to reduce the need for excessive comments.\n","5. Comments significantly contribute to creating clean and understandable code, improving maintainability and collaboration among developers.\n","\n","Comments are a powerful tool in Python programming that enhances code comprehension and encourages efficient teamwork. By following the best practices, developers can make their code more readable and maintainable, leading to improved code quality and productivity.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"50C8KdbjLlIx"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"H7DFDCaWLh4b","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1691016398674,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Lawrence Gray","userId":"13939893748745511637"}},"outputId":"58cbde4f-efb5-40c0-a147-d48e24744f21"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}],"source":["# this is a singline-line comment\n","print(\"Hello, World!\") # This is another comment"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["'''\n","This is a multi-line comment or docstring.\n","It can span across multiple lines and is often used\n","to document the purpose and usage of functions or classes\n","'''"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"aSII7MfTbpn2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1691016496222,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":192,"user":{"displayName":"Lawrence Gray","userId":"13939893748745511637"}},"outputId":"5976bfb8-1966-47ba-ea03-e191dcfab70e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'\\nThis is a multi-line comment or docstring.\\nIt can span across multiple lines and is often used\\nto document the purpose and usage of functions or classes\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]}]}
